        <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
        <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br> 
            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br> 
            text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br> 
            of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br> 
            survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br> 
            typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br> 
            the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br> 
            Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br> 
            software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
        <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the <br> 
            readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of <br>
             using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution <br> 
             of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',<br> 
             making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing <br> 
             packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their <br> 
             default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover <br> 
             many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved <br> 
             over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

        <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br> 
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br> 
            making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin <br> 
            professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of <br> 
            the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, <br>
             and going through the cites of the word in classical <br> 
             literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum <br> 
             comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum <br> 
             et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in <br> 
             45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular <br> 
             during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem <br> 
             ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. <br>   
             The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is <br> 
            reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and <br> 
            1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also <br> 
            reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English <br> 
            versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

        <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,<br> 
            but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected <br> 
            humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly <br> 
            believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you <br> 
            need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the <br> 
            middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet <br> 
            tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the <br> 
            first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 <br> 
            Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence <br> 
            structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The <br> 
            generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, <br> 
            injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
